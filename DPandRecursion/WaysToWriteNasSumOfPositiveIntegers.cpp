/**
Print all unique integer partitions given an integer as input.
Integer partition is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.
for ex: Input=4 then output should be Output=

  1 1 1 1
  1 1 2
  2 2
  1 3
  4
  Note : This is different from problem: print all subsets of N with sum to N, which do not consider distinct combinations
  It considers distinct combinations

 The process is recursive. There is a single partition of 0, the empty set (). There is a single partition of 1, the set (1). 
 There are two partitions of 2, the sets (1 1) and (2).
 There are three partitions of 3, the sets (1 1 1), (1 2) and (3). 
 There are five partitions of 4, the sets (1 1 1 1), (1 1 2), (1 3), (2 2), and (4).
 There are seven partitions of 5, the sets (1 1 1 1 1), (1 1 1 2), (1 2 2), (1 1 3), (1 4), (2 3) and (5). And so on.
 In each case, the next-larger set of partitions is determined by adding each integer x less than or equal to the 
 desired integer n to all the sets formed by the partition of n âˆ’ x,eliminating any duplicates.
